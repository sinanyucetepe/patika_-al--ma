        <p > <em>The recipe for the mosaic cake is not originally Turkish, but like its other<br>
            European counterpart, créme caramel, the mosaic cake has worked its <br>
            way into Turkish urban cuisine in the last century. <br>
            Today, it has become a favorite dessert to end the meal with. <br><br>
            Nearly every Turkish mom makes this easy dessert for her children, <br>
            and even the most highly acclaimed pastry houses in Istanbul offer a version <br>
            of it in their shops. It's considered an old standby recipe when you're in  <br>
            a rush, and you can also use it with other ingredients to put together <br>
            some very fancy desserts.<br><br>

         <ul style="vertical-align:left;margin:0px ; font-size:larger;">
            <li>1 pound / 500 grams petit beurre biscuits</li>
            <li>1 cup sugar</li>
            <li>½ cup cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp. vanilla extract</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup / 225 grams butter</li>
            <li>3 ounces / 80 grams bitter chocolate</li>
            <li>a long, narrow loaf pan</li>
            <li>clean plastic bag, cut open to make a rectangle</li> <br>
         </ul>
         <h2 style="vertical-align:left;margin:0px ; color: rgb(136, 0, 136);">Recipe</h2><br>
             <ol style="vertical-align:left;margin:0px ; font-size: larger;"> 
                <li>Next, whisk the sugar, vanilla, and cocoa powder into the butter and chocolate and mix well. <br>
                     Whisk in the eggs and mix well until thickened.</li>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the broken biscuits and the chocolate mixture by turning it  <br>
                     gently with a wooden spoon until all the crackers come in contact with the chocolate.</li>
                <li>Line your loaf pan with the clean plastic sheet. Then, fill the pan over the plastic and pack <br>
                     the mixture down as tightly as you can with the back of the spoon. Once all the mixture has been packed down, smooth the top, then close the edges of the plastic over the top.</li>
                <li>Refrigerate the mosaic cake for several hours or overnight before serving. When the cake is set, <br>
                     unwrap the plastic from one end and begin slicing it. Close the plastic again and keep your cake in the refrigerator for several days.</li>
